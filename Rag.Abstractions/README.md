# Rag.Abstractions

This folder contains core abstractions and interfaces for the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system.

## Purpose

The Rag.Abstractions project defines the fundamental interfaces and abstract classes that form the foundation of the RAG system. These abstractions ensure consistent behavior across different implementations and provide a clear contract for the system's components.

## Key Components

- Core interfaces for RAG operations
- Abstract base classes for common functionality
- Type definitions and shared contracts
- Common enums and constants

## Usage

This project should be referenced by other projects in the solution that need to implement or use the core RAG functionality. It provides the contract that all implementations must follow.
