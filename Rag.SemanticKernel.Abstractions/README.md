# Rag.SemanticKernel.Abstractions

This project contains the core abstractions and interfaces used throughout the Semantic Kernel application. It defines the contract for various components including LLM models and parsers.

## Structure

- `LlmModel/`: Contains abstractions for language model interactions
- `Parser/`: Contains parsing-related interfaces and base classes

## Purpose

This project serves as the foundation for the application's architecture by:
- Defining common interfaces
- Establishing contracts between components
- Providing base abstractions for extensibility

## Usage

This project is typically referenced by other projects in the solution that need to implement these abstractions or work with the defined interfaces.
