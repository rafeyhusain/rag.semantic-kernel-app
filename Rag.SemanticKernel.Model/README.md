This project contains the core data models and DTOs used throughout the Semantic Kernel application. 
It includes models for vector operations and API interactions.

## Structure

- `Vector/`: Contains models related to vector operations and embeddings
- `Api/`: Contains API request/response models and DTOs

## Purpose

This project serves as the central location for:
- Data transfer objects (DTOs)
- Domain models
- API contracts
